Publishes camera pose using pcl/KinfuLS

## Subscribing Topics
* `~input/info` (`sensor_msgs/CameraInfo`)

  Intrinsic camera parameter of depth image
* `~input/depth` (`sensor_msgs/Image`)

  Depth image in m and the format should be 32FC1
* `~input/color` (`sensor_msgs/Image`)

  RGB color image (not yet used)

## Publishing Topics
* `~output` (`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`)

  Pose of camera
* `~output/cloud` (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`)

  Registered scene pointcloud

## Advertising Services
* `~save_mesh` (`std_srvs/Empty`)

  Convert tsdf->mesh using marching cubes algorithm, saved as ~/.ros/mesh.ply

* `~get_tsdf` (`jsk_recognition_msgs/GetTsdf`)

  Get tsdf volume, also publish as unknown, empty or occupied. The topics are below.
  The occupied topic is too big(if resolution of kinfu is set as default), so may not be shown in rviz or others.
  You can use nodelet for subscribing occupied data.
  It takes much time to convert tsdf->cloud, so not always published.

* `~output/unknown` (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`)

* `~output/empty` (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`)
