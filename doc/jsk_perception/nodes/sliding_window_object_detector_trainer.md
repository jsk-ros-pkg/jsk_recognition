# SlidingWindowObjectDetectorTrainer
## What is this?
Nodelet to train `jsk\_perception/SlidingWindowObjectDetector` using binary support vector machine. The object is assigned a label of +1 and -1 otherwise. The SVM used is from the OpenCV Library with default set to RBF Kernel and 10-Fold Cross Validations. 

Note that this nodelet produces two output files of ".xml" format to the working directory.
* `1) Trained Classifier` - this file the trained object SVM. Dont edit this file.
* `2) sliding_window_trainer_manifest.xml` - this file contains parameters of the trainer that are not in (1). Information such as trainer window size, save directory, etc.
