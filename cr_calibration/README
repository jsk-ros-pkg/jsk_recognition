CR Capture calibration

You have to finish 3 processes listed below.
step 1) stereo camera calibration
step 2) mono camera calibration for range sensor
step 3) measurement for external parameter between stereo camera and range sensor

Topics needed for this calibration are listed below.
Topics from stereo camera are required to be synchronized.
(you can use stereo_synchronizer for synchronizing camera topics)

/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/left/image_raw
/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/left/camera_info
/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/right/image_raw
/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/right/camera_info
/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/range/intensity/image_raw
/CAMERA_NAMESPACE/range/camera_info


step 1) stereo camera calibration
  * Required topics
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/left/image_raw
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/right/image_raw
  
  $ roslaunch cr_calibration stereo_calib.launch
     (You should set topics and calibration board size
      depend on your environment.)
  
step 2) mono camera calibration for range sensor
  * Required topic
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/range/intensity/image_raw
  
  $ roslaunch cr_calibration range_calib.launch
     (You should set topics and calibration board size
      depend on your environment. )
  
step 3) measurement for external parameter between stereo camera and range sensor
  * Required topics
    Each camera_info topics should publish values which 
     were measured in step 1) and step 2)

  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/left/image_rect
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/stereo/left/camera_info
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/range/intensity/image_raw
  /CAMERA_NAMESPACE/range/camera_info
  
  $ roslaunch cr_calibration cr_calib.launch
     (You should set topics and calibration board size
      depend on your environment. )
